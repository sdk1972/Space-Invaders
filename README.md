# Space-Invaders
A take on the classic Space Invaders game with some physics thrown in for fun.

Rationale
Building on ant behaviour simulation, space invaders uses self-learning bots
to attack Earth. 

Alien invaders use limited information to make decisions about how and when to attack.
However, simple rules from multiple bots could give rise to complex and evolving 
behaviour making the game more challenging. Let's see.
